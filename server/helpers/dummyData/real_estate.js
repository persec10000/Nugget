        `Hello, ` + '\n' + 
        `I am reaching out to inquire about working with you on purchasing a home. As it is my first time, I am not entirely sure how the process works and so below, I discuss some details that I think might be relevant to you. ` + '\n' + 
        `I would be looking for a property suitable for my family. My fiancee and I have 2 kids: a 3 year old and a 1 year old. We have lived in Toronto all of our lives and are currently living with my fiancee's parents in a townhouse in west Toronto, which is convenient because they help take care of the kids and our pet hound when they can. My parents help sometimes too and they take just one streetcar down to get to the house, so itâ€™s convenient for them too. But my fiancee and I both work in North York. ` + '\n' + 
        `We own a car but honestly, we prefer to take public transit, order Ubers, or even walk whenever we can. We don't think we are too picky about the exact location (we aren't too sure about what we specifically want just yet) as long as the essentials are within a short distance. A good park nearby where we can take the kids and our dog would be great too. When it comes to price, we are living pretty comfortably and have been good with financial management and think we can make most houses within an average price point work. The trick is that we are trying to move in as soon as we can because our current living situation is becoming rather stressful, as a result of the limited space. ` + '\n' + 
        `Would you be able to help us find our new home? ` + '\n' + 
        `Best,` + '\n' +
