  title: 'Software Engineering Challenge',

  test_desc:
    'You work as a full-time software engineer on a team that is responsible for designing, developing, and troubleshooting new software for the country’s leading product innovation firm. The product innovation firm that you work for has decided on “Learning from Failures” as a company-wide strategic priority this year. Your team’s current project is to look for past failed projects, “learn” from these failures, and build something that you believe can be successful. Your team has agreed to work independently first and have everyone generate ideas on their own before meeting again as a group. Look through the cases and identify a problem you want to focus on, collect information from these cases, generate some cool ideas, and then recommend one final product that you would pitch to your group.',

      `The product` + '\n' + 
      `DRAMA (Design RAtionale MAnagement) was a commercialization of a University prototype for recording the decision-making process during the design of complex and long-lived artefacts, for example nuclear reactors and chemical plants. By recording it in a structured database this information would still be available long after the original engineers had forgotten it, retired or been run over by buses. This information was believed to be incredibly valuable to later maintainers of the system, engineers creating similar designs and industry regulators. The development was part funded by 4 big process engineering companies.` + '\n' + 
      `Why it was judged a commercial failure` + '\n' + 
      `Everyone told us what a great idea it was, but no one bought it. despite some early funding from some big process engineering companies, none of them put it into use properly and we never sold any licences to anyone else.` + '\n' + 
      `What went wrong` + '\n' + 
      `Lack of support from the people who would actually have to use it. There are lots of social factors that work against engineers wanting to record their design rationale, including:` + '\n' + 
      `The person taking the time to record the rationale probably isn’t the person getting the benefit from it.` + '\n' + 
      `Extra work for people who are already under a lot of time pressure.` + '\n' + 
      `It might make it easier for others to question decisions and hold companies and engineers accountable for mistakes.` + '\n' + 
      `Engineers may see giving away this knowledge as undermining their job security.` + '\n' + 
      `Problems integrating with the other software tools that engineers spend most of their time in (e.g. CAD packages). This would probably be easier with modern web-based technology.` + '\n' + 
      `It is difficult to capture the subtleties of the design process in a structured form.` + '\n' + 
      `A bad hire. If you hire the wrong person, you should face up to it and get rid of them. Rather than keep moving them around in a vain attempt to find something they are good at.` + '\n' + 
      `We took a phased approach, starting with a single-user proof of concept and then creating a client-server version. In hindsight it should have been obvious that not enough people were actively using the single-user system and we should have killed it then.` + '\n' + 
      `The product` + '\n' + 
      `Highlighter. A utility to print neatly formatted, syntax highlighted source code listings.` + '\n' + 
      `Why it was judged a commercial failure` + '\n' + 
      `I earnt a grand total of £442.52 (about $700 in todays money) in just over two years, so I guess it paid for itself if you exclude my time.` + '\n' + 
      `What went wrong` + '\n' + 
      `Since it was my first product and I was very green about both marketing and product development. I would suggest the following would have made things better:` + '\n' + 
      `Get feedback from potential users about the product (eg from the ASP forums). Some parts of the program where probably too option heavy and geeky.` + '\n' + 
      `Diversify. If people didn’t want to print fancy listings, maybe they would have wanted them formatted in HTML.` + '\n' + 
      `Better marketing. I’m not sure this would have saved it, but all I knew in those days was uploading to shareware sites. I never even sent a press release.` + '\n' + 
      `I figure it failed simply because it was a product nobody wanted. Actually, more importantly than that, it was a product *I* didn’t want to use, but it developed from a larger product I was working on, on the assumption I could earn some money on the side from part of the code.  Since then I’ve stuck to products which I’ve actually wanted to use myself. There’s a lot to be said for dogfooding, not just for debugging, but for knowing where the pain points are and what extra features could be added.` + '\n' + 
      `The product` + '\n' + 
      `ScreenRest – a consumer software product that reminds users to take regular rest breaks while using their computer.` + '\n' + 
      `Why it was judged a commercial failure` + '\n' + 
      `ScreenRest failed commercially because we built a product without having a clearly defined market.  This was compounded by it offering prevention, not a solution. ScreenRest continues to regularly sell a small number of licences but not in sufficient quantity to justify further enhancements.  The conversion rates are good, but there are simply not enough visitors to the website.` + '\n' + 
      `What went wrong` + '\n' + 
      `Not doing market research first.` + '\n' + 
      `Creating a prevention rather than solution product – people generally wait until they have a problem and then look for a solution.` + '\n' + 
      `Creating a product with medical associations – the SEO and PPC competition for related keywords is prohibitive for a product with a low purchase price.`,
