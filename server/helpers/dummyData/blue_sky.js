  test_desc:
    'You are a tenured artist signed to one of the record labels currently dominating the music industry. The record label hosts monthly meetings called “blue-sky” meetings where attendees - artists like you - are encouraged to present a detailed plan for a new song, that can be of any genre, any composition, and on any topic. Attendees are encouraged to think big. Within this challenge, identify the components that you would like to include in your plan, collect information from the provided resources, engender some ideas to select from when formulating your plan, and recommend your big idea in a plan that you will present in this meeting.',

        `These resources are provided in advance to all meeting attendees. With these resources, attendees are presented lyrics of a randomly selected song from the label’s roster. Aside from the lyrics, the general elements of the song are identified. As well, the specific elements of the song are identified under the heading “Specific Elements of Song” alongside the part of the song that the elements are relevant to. These elements are not necessarily elements that the label executives are looking for, but they should give you an idea of what kinds of information to consider when developing your plan.` +
