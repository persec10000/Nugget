  title: 'Business Strategy Proposal',

  test_desc:
    'You work as a full-time employee for a medium-sized company. Over the last two years, your company has been experiencing a steady decline in operating profit. This decline is due to both a decrease in average sales and increase in average expenses. With the desire to tap into internal resources to help with this issue, company executives have decided to form a cross-functional team with selected existing employees to help rectify this problem. You were selected to join this cross-functional team. As a group, you had your first meeting and have agreed that prior to meeting as a group again and discussing the issue further, you will each first generate individual ideas for what the problem is, why there is a problem, and what can be done to address it. Your presentation is in 20 minutes!',

      `I thought the customer service was pretty good. More straight-to-the-point than anything but the representative got the job done, and quickly too, so I can’t complain.` + '\n' + 
      `Really enjoy the efficient customer service at this company! When I came in, the worker was helpful and answered all the questions I had (and trust me, I had a lot!). You have yourself a loyal customer in me.` + '\n' + 
      `I’m so done with this company. Every time I’ve had encounters with staff from this company, I’ve had the worst experiences. From being put on hold for close to an hour, to dismissive and rude attitudes, to being bounced around from person to person, I always feel like my time is wasted. I don’t even expect anything beyond the bare minimum of business dealings - just some basic courtesy and proper operations is all I hope for.` + '\n' + 
      `Definitely felt as if I was treated like just a number here. I’m a 3 year customer, a pretty low maintenance one too at that, but the one time I needed to speak to someone about an issue, I felt like I was speaking to a robot. I’m not expecting to be treated like royalty or anything like that, but I just couldn’t shake off how distant the worker seemed.`,
