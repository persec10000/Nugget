        `I am the owner of a fitness retailer business that has remained local in reach for the last 5 years. We have always specialized in space-saving equipment and, even though we sell all kinds of other equipment too, we have found success with this specialty. ` + '\n' + 
        `With the recent development of condos in the city, we have been more successful than ever. The demand for space-saving equipment has increased substantially. We have been fortunate to have only a few competitors in the city but we are concerned that with the city's commercial development plans, that there might be more competitors within this space soon. ` + '\n' + 
        `In anticipation of this, I am seeking web development services from you. We currently have a Facebook page and Instagram account devoted to advertising our store, our monthly events, and special deals and promotions. We have a pretty active (local but active) following on these social media accounts. We had a very basic website up until 3 years ago but we found it difficult to maintain. ` + '\n' +
