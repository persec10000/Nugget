The goal of these meetings is to ensure everyone is working towards the monthly and quarterly goals. The organization focuses on collaboration, growth and development, and respect of one’s colleagues and clients. The organization is typically a strong competitor in the industry and employs individuals with high performance. However, in the past year, your team has been experiencing some issues. You have been asked to bring recommendations for your team to today’s board meeting to ensure performance does not continue to decline. Using the resources provided, you must formulate recommendations to present at the board meeting in 25 minutes.',

        'Your team has been rated using a 360-degree feedback approach. The scores reported below have been averaged from supervisor, subordinate and colleague reports, with these employees making up 30% of those in the organization. Scales can range from 1 to 7. 1 indicates not meeting expectations (needing improvement), 4 indicates meeting expectations and 7 indicates exceeding expectations. I have been impressed with the team’s overall performance, especially Ellen’s ability to politely and promptly respond to client requests and meet their needs.' +

        '\nOver the last three months I’ve felt repeatedly harassed my team member, Tom. He often makes rude comments towards us in meetings when we share our ideas. For example, the other day he said ‘contributions like that are why women belong in the kitchen.’ He has caused a divide in our team between men and women. His influence has resulted in the men not respecting our opinions or wanting to implement our ideas. Recently, Tom has even become more hostile towards the women and is making it even more difficult to get work done as a team. This has made for issues with collaboration and an inhospitable work environment. ' +
