      `I feel overburdened by my work sometimes. It seems like I’m handed more and more things to do. Constantly stressed out.` + '\n' + 
      `It’s not bad around here. I mean, do we have meetings all the time? Do I feel like I’m constantly replying to emails and my time is sucked up doing these things? Absolutely. Am I overly upset about how things are around here? No. Work is work.` + '\n' + 
      `I had my first child 2 years ago and I have yet to find a balance between being a dad and being a manager. Whenever I spend time with my daughter, I feel guilty for being away from my work. And when I’m at work, I feel guilty for being away from her. Wishing for that middle ground.` + '\n' + 
      `I like to do work on my own. I don’t really like to mingle. And I’m satisfied that I get the opportunity to do that around here. People don’t really bother me, I don’t bother them. I can be in and out without speaking to others. It seems to me that many others are the same way.`,
