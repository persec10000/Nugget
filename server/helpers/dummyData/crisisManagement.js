  test_desc:
    'You are a management consultant. Your new client is a growing healthcare tech company that has reached out to you with concerns about their customer service employees. Over the past year, customer complaints have doubled, with 39% of customers rating the service they received as unsatisfactory. The organization has offered additional training sessions to these employees but has not seen improvements. With the provided resources, try to identify the problem, collect key information, and recommend a solution to your new client.',

      'Training can be a powerful medium when there is proof that the root cause of the learning need is an undeveloped skill or knowledge deficit. For those situations, a well-designed program with customized content, relevant case material, skill building practice, and a final measurement of skill acquisition, works great.' + '\n' + 'Ineffective decision-making processes that failed to clarify which leaders and groups owned which decisions' + '\n' + 'Given these systemic issues, it’s unlikely a training program would have had a productive, or sustainable outcome. Worse, it could have backfired, making management look out of touch.Learning is a consequence of thinking, not teaching. It happens when people reflect on and choose a new behavior. But if the work environment doesn’t support that behavior, a well-trained employee won’t make a difference. Here are three conditions needed to ensure a training solution sticks.' + '\n' + 'Internal systems support the newly desired behavior. Spotting unwanted behavior is certainly a clue that something needs to change. But the origins of that unwanted behavior may not be a lack of skill. Individual behaviors in an organization are influenced by many factors, like: how clearly managers establish, communicate, and stick to priorities, what the culture values and reinforces, how performance is measured and rewarded, or how many levels of hierarchy there are. These all play a role in shaping employee behaviors.' + '\n' + 'If you are going to invest millions of dollars into company training, be confident it is addressing a strategic learning need. Further, be sure your organization can and will sustain new skills and knowledge by addressing the broader factors that may threaten their success. If you aren’t confident in these conditions, don’t spend the money.' + '\n' + 'The client has sent over a sample of complaints they have received from customers' + '\n' + '“I am extremely disappointed in the service (or lack thereof) I have received from your company. Yesterday, I called over and over from early afternoon until the evening and couldn’t get ahold of anyone. When I finally got through, I was put on hold for 18 minutes. Then, there was no apologies or anything, only excuses for the phones being busy all day. I finally got the issue with the platform straightened out but still, by that point, I was so frustrated and disappointed that it didn’t feel like that mattered.”',
